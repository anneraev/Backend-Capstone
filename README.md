## Plugin Sleuth

Working with smaller, less-utilized game engines such as RPG Maker and Game Maker can be fun. If you're a developer making plugins and resources for other developers, it can mean a smaller more dedicated community for creating great new tools and systems that get along great with other resources. However, finding resources such as plugins and libraries for these engines can be an arduous journey through irrelevant google results and massive forum threads. PluginSleuth aims to provide a directory for all these resources, linking them together under one comprehensive search and version-control system.

## Robust Search Feature
At the heart of this website is its search feature, which lets the user search by title or keyword and then filter by engine, type and even download cost and usage agreement.

## Uplead Plugins
Users can become plugin authors by uploading and maintaining pages for their plugins. By navigating to their MY Plugins list, they can create a tab for new versions of existing plugins, edit delete or unlist a plugiin page, or create a new plugin page. A created and listed plugin page will be searchable by all members, allowing developers to easily find an author's work. An author can add a link directing users to their own site for downloading.

## Versioning
Versioning features lets you upload and download plugins by version, each with their own download link and associated reamdme.

## Watch List
Users can add plugins to their watch list, so that they always have a collection of plugins that they are using for easy access. The button to do so is situated at the top of every plugin page.

## Try it!

Plugin Sleuth is not live at the moment. However, if you wish to demo it, you can clone down the file, run it in Microsoft Visual Studio and hit the debug button. This will open up the most recent version of the site. A live, hosted version is coming soon for use by the games developer community.
